# Marking the Audio

Marking the audio is a process where one can divide the audio track of a text into sentences for use in the "unscramble" exercises. To mark the audio:
- Navigate to the reader.
- Set the audio track to the start of the text.
- Press "m". The audio will start playing and you should see the current sentence highlighted.
- Press "m" again before the start of the next sentence.
- Continue until the text is complete.
